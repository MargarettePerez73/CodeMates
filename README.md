This project combines learning with entertainment, offering a quiz game with two categories: Random Facts and Computer Programming. The user can select their preferred category to test their knowledge in an engaging and educational way. Whether you're looking to learn new random facts or brush up on your computer programming skills, this quiz game ensures you have fun while being educated. The code is structured into distinct functions, each handling a specific aspect of the game, from displaying questions to checking answers, keeping score, and providing feedback. This modular approach makes the game easy to understand and maintain. The random facts consists a collection of fun and interesting facts that you may or may not heard of or familiar with. While the Programming Category questions covers the recent topics we have recently learned.

This project was made on Visual Studio and consists .csv files.
