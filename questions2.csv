Returns the index number for the first instance of the value you are passing,Index,Extends,Lists,Unpacking,1
This adds a single value to the end of a list,Extends,Append,Index,Lists,2
This accepts an iterable and appends each item from that iterable to the end of the list,Append,Index,Lists,Extends,4
This method returns a shallow copy of a list,copy,deep copy,duplicate,redundant,1
This method will make a copy of a list AND any nested objects contained inside that list,copy,deep copy,duplicate,redundant,2
This method removes all items from a list,del,remove,clear,pop,3
This method will remove the FIRST element in the list that has a value of x,del,remove,clear,pop,2
This method removes AND returns the last element from a list.,del,remove,clear,pop,4
This statement can be used to delete an item from a specific index in a list,del,remove,clear,pop,1
This method returns the number of times a value occurs in a list,join,sort,Count,reverse,3
This is a string method that combine together the elements of an iterable into a single string,sort,reverse,join,split,3
This is a string method that will separates a string on a given character,reverse,split,join,sort,2
This repeats as long as expression is True,array,loops,continue,break,2
This keyword end the current iteration of the loop but does not break out of the loop,for,loops,continue,break,3
This keyword is to prematurely exit a loop and usually this is done inside of a conditional,array,loops,continue,break,4
If none of the above were True, do this,if,else,else if,condition,2
If not the first thing, maybe try this instead?,if,else,else if,condition,3
There are only two possible values which are True and False.,Conditionals,Boolean,Index,Lists,2
These are verbs or actions that the computer or computer language will already know how to perform,Variables,Functions,Comments,Code,2
This is just a container for a value within your own program,Variables,Functions,Comments,Code,1
